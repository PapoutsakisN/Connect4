Here we have the classic game of connect 4.
The purpose of the game is to make 4 same color matches in a row,diagonical or horizontial.
The game is consisted from a table of 6 rows and 7 columns, 2 colors (yellow and red).
From the beginning yellow is for player 1 and red for player 2.
I have buttons on the top of each column so the player can choose in which column he want to toss his token.
There is a score board under the game board with pre-fixed win-draw records.
Also on the rigth there is a board with the information of the player playing, the moves we have and the time needed to play.

First page is a welcome to the game and let the player choose if he wants a game against a friend or against the computer.
The computer ai is a simple one , it just choose a random column and plays, without checking if there is a better move.
